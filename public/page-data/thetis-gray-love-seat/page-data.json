The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":10,"id":"8c1b81ec-16b1-4a09-8b9a-cd8ae8ba2cb4"},"title":"Thetis Gray Love Seat","type":"itemPage","next":{"categories":["new arrivals","sofas"],"name":"Mod Leather Sofa","price":"800","image":"../images/products/couch6.png","description":"Easy to love.
